Marstek Device Open API（Rev 1.0）	 
The Local API is provided “as is” for local use only. Use at your own risk. Marstek is not liable for any damages, data loss, or legal issues caused by your use of the API. You are responsible for lawful and appropriate use.
Ⅰ. Preface	 
Welcome!
This document provides an introduction to the Open API for Marstek devices, which is available to device owners and enables integration with third-party systems.
While Marstek offers an official mobile app and cloud services, this Open API is designed for advanced users who wish to gain greater control over their devices and seamlessly integrate them into other management platforms.
Ⅱ. General Description	 
Marstek devices communicate with third-party systems over a Local Area Network (LAN). Before using this API, please ensure that:
The Marstek device is properly connected to your home network.
The Open API feature has been enabled via the Marstek mobile app.
Please note that different Marstek models may support only a subset of the commands described in this documentation. Additionally, enabling the Open API may cause certain built-in features of the device to be disabled in order to prevent command conflicts. For detailed information about supported commands and any functional limitations for specific models, please refer to Chapter 4 of this document.
2.1 Protocol Format	 
       The protocol utilizes the JSON format, with commands primarily categorized into query commands, configuration commands, and certain special commands.
Command Format
Property	Type	Description
id	number or string	An identifier established by the Client.
method	string	A Structured value that holds the parameter values to be used during the invocation of the method.
params	object	Parameters that the method takes.

2.2 API over UDP	 
2.2.1 First-Time Use	 
       When users first use the Open API service, they need to follow the configuration process below:
Connect the device to power and turn it on;
Use the Marstek APP to connect and bind the device, and configure the WiFi network for the device or connect it to the Ethernet;
 	Enable the device's API feature in the APP, and set the UDP port number. The default port number is 30000, and the recommended port number is between 49152 and 65535.
      After completing the above operations, the Marstek device can normally receive UDP commands from the same local area network.
2.2.2 Discovering Devices	 
      To discover Marstek devices within the LAN, a UDP broadcast is utilized. The broadcast content is as follows:
 
        If there are Marstek devices within the LAN, taking Venus C as an example, the following response will be received
 
       The device's IP address can be directly obtained from the Marstek APP or the home router. If this functionality is to be used on a long-term basis, it is recommended to configure the device with a static IP address.
